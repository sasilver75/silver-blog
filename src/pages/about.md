Hi, I'm **Sam Silver**, a 24 year old Software Engineer from [Mequon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mequon,_Wisconsin), Wisconsin. During undergraduate at [WashU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis), I interned at companies like [Jet](https://jet.com/) and [MasterCard](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us.html) in analytics, operations, and product management roles. I spent most of my time during my senior year taking statistical programming courses online on Coursera and MITx after stumbling across a copy of [ISLR](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370).

After my largely theoretical coursework in Finance and Computer Science, the world of machine learning seemed so obviously practical and interesting that I entered an MS program in computational data analytics at [Georgia Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology). 

After a few months in the program, I began to realize a few things:
1. The best learning materials in both statistics and computer science weren't being offered at Georgia Tech; they were open-source materials available for *free* online. Paying a *lot* of time and money to sit in a room with a bunch of other smart students paying for sub-optimal content made me feel... not smart.
2. Predictive modeling is a fun, iterative process, but the infrastructure feeding data to these models and the applications that wrap them are arguably more important than the models themselves. To leave the walled garden of modeling, I'd have to broaden my technical skillset.

And so, after three semesters at Georgia Tech, I stepped away from the program, threw everything that I owned into my car, and drove across the country to the west coast for a software engineering immersive program called [Codesmith](https://www.codesmith.io/) in Los Angeles. Since then, I've fallen in love with JavaScript, the Web, and SoCal weather.

Like in my ML studies, I've been lucky to enter the field at such an auspicious time -- new libraries and browser APIs are enabling amazing new applications, and, as in my previous studies, the open-source materials available for curious learners to learn from are *amazing*. I'll be looking to connect my ML and SWE skills at some time in the future, but for now I'm having a blast diving deep into broader software engineering.

I'm currently excited about React and GraphQL on the front end, but am also reading a great [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032175.do) on distributed applications from O'Reilly. I'm looking for a front-end or full-stack role on the West Coast with a company that uses modern technologies, has a great testing and code-review culture, and is excited about mentoring passionate early-career engineers.

When I'm not cracking Leetcode problems and interviewing, you can find me laying on the beach, reading, and listening to podcasts. If you have or want any content recommendations, don't hesitate to reach out! 

*Thank You for reading!*
